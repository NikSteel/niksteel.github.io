  quote: "Nik worked in a very organized manner that was like the adhesive to our whole student group named Acoustic Zoo. Where I was the Idea generator; Nik helped bring everything to life with his technical skills and know how. He built many projects and organized our weekly meetings with great precision and attention to detail. Without the help from him, our group dedicated to helping students learn about the science of sound would have not been successful."}

I founded and lead as president a UWSA student club at the University of Windsor called 
Acoustic Zoo that offered opportunities for audio enthusiasts to learn about acoustics
and audio production techniques in a friendly, hands-on environment. I collaborated with
Aaron Eichler, the club's vice president, and David Bergeron, the club's treasurer, to 
plan and facilitate twelve successful club activities over the 2014-2015 school year:

* **Cymatics** - the study of making sound waves visible, featuring wave patterns in sand, water,
  and non-newtonian fluid over various materials.
  
* **The Sounds of SciFi** - a hands-on introduction to sound design and making classic science 
  fiction sound effects such as the sounds of lightsabers, laser guns, and robot voices.

* **The Sounds of Horror** - a hands-on introduction to sound design and making classic horror film
  sound effects such as the sounds of screeching metal, thunder, wind, and rain.
  
* **Piano Recording Workshop** - a hands-on introduction to studio recording and microphone selection and placement.
  
* **Glitch n' Bitch** - an electronic music jam session and hands-on introduction to synthesizers.

* **Ableton Live Tour** - a tour through the interface of a popular audio program called Ableton Live.
  
* **Simpler Sampling** - an introduction to sampling instruments and instrument racks in Ableton Live.

* **Meet and Bleep** - an electronic music jam session and hands-on introduction to synthesizers.

* **Pop-Up Art** - an ambient music performance for students attending an arts fair on campus.

* **DIY Ribbon Mic Group Buy** - a group buy for Austin DIY ribbon microphone kits followed by a workshop to
  construct the microphones.
  
* **DIY Ribbon Mic Showcase** - a presentation and recording workshop to demonstrate the ribbon 
  microphones that were made by Acoustic Zoo members.
  
* **Analog Synthesis** - a lecture hosted in collaboration with Hackforge on how synthesizers work followed by
  an opportunity for attendees to play with a variety of analog synthesizers.

Now that we have completed university, we hope to continue Acoustic Zoo as a group for 
audio enthusiasts and electro-acoustic musicians independent of the University and the UWSA.
