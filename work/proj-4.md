The [ErgoDox](http://ergodox.org/) is an ergonomic keyboard designed by a community of mechanical keyboard
enthusiasts and sold as a DIY kit by [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/home).  I purchased the DIY
kit and assembled my ErgoDox keyboard from basic components.

I also made a custom ergonomic desk to position the keys
directly beneath my fingers when I type.

</div>

The typing experience is excellent. I also learned about device drivers
in the process when I edited the firmware code to customize the key layout.
The code may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NikSteel/ergodox-firmware).
