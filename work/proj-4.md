The [ErgoDox](http://ergodox.org/) is an ergonomic keyboard designed by a community of mechanical keyboard
enthusiasts and made easy to purchase as a DIY kit by [Massdrop](massdrop.com).  I purchased the DIY
kit and assembled my ErgoDox keyboard from basic components.

I also made a custom ergonomic desk to position the keys
directly beneath my fingers when I type.

It really is great to type on and I learned a bit about device drivers
in the process because it was necessary to download the source code, 
tweak the key layout directly in the C driver code, compile it, and burn
into the device firmware chip.
