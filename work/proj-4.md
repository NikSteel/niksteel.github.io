The [ErgoDox](http://ergodox.org/) is an ergonomic keyboard designed by a community of mechanical keyboard
enthusiasts and made easy to purchase as a DIY kit by [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/home).  I purchased the DIY
kit and assembled my ErgoDox keyboard from basic components.

I also made a custom ergonomic desk to position the keys
directly beneath my fingers when I type.

<div style="width:100%; height:auto">
   <img alt="Ready for testing" src="assets/img/work/proj-4/testinghalf.jpg" style="float:left; width:50%; height:auto">

</div>

It really is great to type on, and I learned about device drivers
in the process as I edited the firmware code to customize the key layout.
