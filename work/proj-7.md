title: Cymatics + LEAP Motion

I created this cymatics rig to demonstrate the physical movement and appearance
of sound waves. A layer of water rests above the surface of a large loudspeaker. 
When the water is excited by low frequency sounds, the sound waves become visible as 
ripples on the surface of the water. Different frequencies cause different wave patterns,
so I used a LEAP motion sensor and Max/MSP to allow a person to control the frequency of the
sound using the height of his or her hand, much like playing a theremin.

This demonstration has been a great success, especially with children! [Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK85ZLdkWlf9xbErDN42zK4v6b1Sabhl_)
are some videos of the rig in action and its evolution over time:

For an Acoustic Zoo workshop, we also experimented with using sand and surfaces coated with a hydrophobic coating:

Here is the latest version of the rig, featuring a vibration table (shown on the left) 
that I made using a bass / couch shaker:
