I organized and facilitated an Acoustic Zoo workshop at my personal workspace in which I and two other club members
-- Rob and Gilbert -- each made a custom ribbon microphone using an Austin Microphones DIY
ribbon mic kit. It was a great experience to learn about what goes into the design of a microphone
and the effects of various design parameters, such as the grill shape, acoustic damping, and the path
around the transducer. The completed microphones sound excellent!
