I organized and facilitated an Acoustic Zoo workshop at my personal workspace in which I and two other club members
-- Rob and Gilbert -- each made a custom ribbon microphone using an Austin Microphones DIY
ribbon mic kit. It was a great experience to learn about what goes into the design of a microphone
and the effects of various design parameters, such as the grill shape, acoustic damping, and the shape of
the truss onto which the magnets are mounted. The completed microphones sound excellent as well!
