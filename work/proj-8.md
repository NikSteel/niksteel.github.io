As an audio engineering student at Coventry University, I conducted an ISO3382 reverb time 
measurement study in one of the high quality recording studios at the campus as part of my 
final project in an acoustics class.

To enhance the report, I made an accurate 3D model of the facility:

In addition to conducting ISO3382 measurements in the Coventry studio, I applied acoustic principles to 
design a hypothetical studio recording room of my own.

Here are some renderings of the design:
