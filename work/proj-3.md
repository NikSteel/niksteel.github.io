I worked with peers to implement a genetic algorithm simulation of the 
iterated prisoner's dilemma game in C++.  The simulation outputs population
demographics and statistics in CSV files that are helpful in assessing the 
effectiveness and influence of certain types of game strategies. We used this 
data in a final report for an introduction to topics in artificial intelligence
class at the University of Windsor. 

The project features contributions from Chris Zygowski, Eric Smith, and Dwayne Alleyne. We brainstormed
the desired functionality and requirements as a group, I wrote all of the C++ code, and then
we debugged the code and determined the best parameters with which to generate our data as a group. 

The source code and information about what the program achieves and how to use it are available 
[here](https://github.com/NikSteel/genetic-algorithm) on GitHub.
